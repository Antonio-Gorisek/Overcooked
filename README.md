# Unity 3D game

This game is currently in development as an educational project, designed to help others learn about Unity and game development. In collaboration with individuals interested in creating games, I started working on a small demo version of an Overcooked game. The goal is to develop the game together while explaining the fundamentals of game creation throughout the process. Through this hands-on approach, participants gain practical experience and contribute to building a fun and interactive cooking simulation.

You can choose a specific version if you wish.
From the very beginning, where only models are included, to specific versions with only certain functions, up to the latest version, you can find them all <a href="https://github.com/Antonio-Gorisek/Overcooked/releases">here</a>.<br> 

## Open Source Project

This project is fully open-source and available to the community. 
All assets used in the game are free to use, and the entire project can be utilized, modified, or redistributed without any restrictions. 
Whether you're a developer looking to learn, build on top of this project, or simply interested in its mechanics, you're free to do so for any purpose.
